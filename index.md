## About me
I am a PhD student at Royal Holloway University of London under the supervision of [Prof. Vincent Jansen](https://pure.royalholloway.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/vincent-jansen(957e9964-1e64-4be5-9601-55e2d5b907cd).html) and [Prof. Elli Leadbeater](https://pure.royalholloway.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/elli-leadbeater(a2edc845-5d79-4c83-bab4-6c58102f485f).html). My research is all about using computational and mathematical models to better understand animal behaviour, particularly collective behaviours. What drives me is a desire to understand how animal behaviour is shaped by their experiences and interactions with others. I am also fascinated by the mechanics of modelling ecological processes and work more broadly on how models can be linked to empirical data.

I love coding and and open, transparent and reproducible science lie at the core of my working routine and so I am committed to organising my data and code under [standard practice](https://carpentries.org/values/).
