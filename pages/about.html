<h1>About me</h1>
<p>I'm a Biology PhD student at Royal Holloway University of London. My research centers around modeling pollinator movement patterns, with a particular focus on honey bees. By constructing and analysing mathematical models, I test theoretical questions of how honey bee hives forage in their local environments with the view to inform ecosystem management.  </p>
<p>Open, transparent and reproducible science lie at the core of my working routine and as such I organise my data and maintain my code under <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/">standard practice</a>.  </p>
<h2>Current research</h2>
<p>I am currently employed on a BBSRC funded 3+1 integrated masters and PhD program with Royal Holloway University of London and Imperial College London under the supervision of <a href="https://pure.royalholloway.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/vincent-jansen%28957e9964-1e64-4be5-9601-55e2d5b907cd%29.html">Prof Vincent Jansen</a>, <a href="https://pure.royalholloway.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/elli-leadbeater(a2edc845-5d79-4c83-bab4-6c58102f485f).html">Prof Elli Leadbeater</a> and <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/r.gill">Dr Richard Gill</a>.  </p>
<p>I am developing foraging distance models using honey bees to identify the scales at which individuals move around their environment. Our aim is to determine the extent to which honey bee movement can be described as scale free. In contrast to other research on scale free movement, our focus is on a central place forager, utalising foraging distance data decoded from hundreds of waggle dance observations from various locations to give us a view of how a hive as a whole forages in different environments.</p>
<p>In addition to phenomenological models, I am interested in extending foraging models to central place foragers by including factors such as extra metabolic costs and hive level processes.</p>
<h2>Qualifications</h2>
<p><strong>2019 -present</strong> PhD. Biology - Royal Holloway University of London<br />
<strong>2019</strong>         MSc. Computational Methods in Ecology &amp; Evolution - Imperial College London<br />
<strong>2017</strong>         MRes. Ecology &amp; Evolution - University of Sheffield<br />
<strong>2016</strong>         BSc. Biology - University of Sheffield  </p>
<h2>Other research</h2>
<p>During my Mres at Sheffield I worked with <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/aps/staff-and-students/acadstaff/gossmann">Dr Toni Gossmann</a> and <a href="https://www.christophercooney.co.uk/">Dr Chris Cooney</a> to investigate the genetic underpinnings of beak shape evolution in birds. During this research I implemented maximum likelihood based models using the ratio of synonymous to non-synonymous substitutions to investigate signatures of selection acting in 18 candidate genes. We then correlated this data with hotspots of rapid beak shape evolution identified from three-dimensional morphometric beak shape scans of 57 birds. Our results found no substantial evidence of protein coding changes in our candidate genes influencing bird break evolution and indicated non-coding regions should be investigated.</p>
<h2>Computational skills</h2>
<p>Whilst I do most of my project coding in Python, I am comfortable working in R, bash, latex, C and SQL. I advocate a flexible and multilingual approach to programming.</p>
<h2>Other interests</h2>
<p>Outside of research I enjoy climbing, hiking and developing my programming skills.   </p>
