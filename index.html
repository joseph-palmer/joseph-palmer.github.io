                    <h2>Current research</h2>
                    <p>My PhD is all about modelling patterns of pollinator movement in order to develop a better understanding of they move through their environment. Under the supervision of <a href="https://pure.royalholloway.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/vincent-jansen%28957e9964-1e64-4be5-9601-55e2d5b907cd%29.html">Prof Vincent Jansen</a>, 
                     <a href="https://pure.royalholloway.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/elli-leadbeater(a2edc845-5d79-4c83-bab4-6c58102f485f).html">Prof Elli Leadbeater</a> and <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/r.gill">Dr Richard Gill</a>,
                    I am developing foraging distance models using honey bees to identify the scales at which individuals collect resources. Our aim is to determine the extent to which honey bee movement can be described as scale free. In contrast to other research on scale free movement, our focus is on a central place forager, utalising foraging distance data decoded from throusands of waggle dance observations from various locations to give us a view of how a hive as a whole forages in different environments.
                    <p>Aside from improving our understanding of hive level foraging behaviours in honey bees, the methods developed during this project will influence other studies of animal movement. More generally, our research into methods of evaluating matters of scale has applications both within and beyond ecology, such as in network theory.</p>
                    <h2>Qualifications</h2>
                    <p><strong>2019 -present</strong> PhD. Biology - Royal Holloway University of London<br />
                    <strong>2019</strong>         MSc. Computational Methods in Ecology &amp; Evolution - Imperial College London<br />
                    <strong>2017</strong>         MRes. Ecology &amp; Evolution - University of Sheffield<br />
                    <strong>2016</strong>         BSc. Biology - University of Sheffield  </p>
                    <h2>Other research</h2>
                    <p>During my Mres at Sheffield I worked with <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/aps/staff-and-students/acadstaff/gossmann">Dr Toni Gossmann</a> and <a href="https://www.christophercooney.co.uk/">Dr Chris Cooney</a> to investigate the genetic underpinnings of beak shape evolution in birds. During this research I implemented maximum likelihood based models using the ratio of synonymous to non-synonymous substitutions to investigate signatures of selection acting in 18 candidate genes. We then correlated this data with hotspots of rapid beak shape evolution identified from three-dimensional morphometric beak shape scans of 57 birds. Our results found no substantial evidence of protein coding changes in our candidate genes influencing bird break evolution and indicated non-coding regions should be investigated.</p>
                    <h2>Computational skills</h2>
                    <p>Whilst I do most of my project coding in Python, I am comfortable working in R, bash, latex, C and SQL. I advocate a flexible and multilingual approach to programming.</p>
                    <h2>Other interests</h2>
                    <p>Outside of research I enjoy climbing, hiking and developing my programming skills.   </p>
