## Honeybee foraging strategies

For my PhD I analyse the honey bee dance floor for statistical footprints left by different foraging behaviours and strategies. I am generating novel methods of analysing the celebrated honey bee waggle dance in an effort to better understand the conflicts between social and personal information, as well the environmental / genetic factors influencing their adoption. This research is of increasing value in an expanding anthropogenic world. As human activity reshapes pollinator habitats, understanding how insects adapt is critical for safeguarding the ecosystem services they provide.

In addition to working on collective behaviour, my research also seeks to develop new methods of analysing animal movements across multiple scales. This work delves deeper into the fundamentals of how models can be linked to data and how we can parametrise or select models.

## covidregionaldata: Transparent subnational data for the Covid-19 pandemic

During the 2nd year of my PhD I spend 3 months working on Covid-19 as a research software engineer for the [epiforecasts](https://epiforecasts.io/aboutus/) team at [The Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases (CMMID)](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research/centres/centre-mathematical-modelling-infectious-diseases/covid-19), London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. In this role I was maintained and developed an existing R package which provided transparent subnational Covid-19 data. After redeveloping this R package to use an object orientated approach, [covidregionaldata](https://github.com/epiforecasts/covidregionaldata), I oversaw its peer review in the [Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.03290). This package has subsequently been used to obtain data for forecasts provided to both the UK, EU and USA governments.

## The genetic basis of avian bill shape diversification

During my Mres at the University of Sheffield I worked with [Dr Toni Gossmann](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/aps/staff-and-students/acadstaff/gossmann) and [Dr Chris Cooney](https://www.christophercooney.co.uk/) to investigate the genetic underpinnings of beak shape evolution in birds. During this research I implemented maximum likelihood based models using the ratio of synonymous to non-synonymous substitutions to investigate signatures of selection acting in 18 candidate genes. We then correlated this data with hotspots of rapid beak shape evolution identified from three-dimensional morphometric beak shape scans of 57 birds.
