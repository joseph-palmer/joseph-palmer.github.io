I work mainly in R, where I have experience writing CRAN listed packages, and Python. I also work in C++, both as stand alone applications or as part of python or R packages. As a [CMEE](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/life-sciences/postgraduate/masters-courses/computational-methods-in-ecology-and-evolution/) graduate, I have received formal training in scientific computing and I am comfortable working in a range of programming languages, including Mathematica, Matlab, bash, SQL, Excel and VBA.
