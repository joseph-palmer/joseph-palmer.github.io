I work mainly in R, where I have experience writing CRAN listed packages, and Python. I also work in C++ when required, both as stand alone applications or as part of python or R packages. I am comfortable working in bash, SQL, Excel and VBA.

As a [CMEE](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/life-sciences/postgraduate/masters-courses/computational-methods-in-ecology-and-evolution/) graduate, I am well trained in computational methods. As such I adopt a flexible and multilingual approach to programming.
