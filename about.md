I'm a 3rd year Biology PhD student at Royal Holloway University of London. My research is concerned with modelling animal behaviour, particularly collective behaviour. For my PhD I model the honey bee dance floor, searching for statistical footprints left by specific behaviours to investigate to what extent honeybee foraging occurs collectively of individually. By generating novel methods of analysing the celebrated honey bee waggle dance, my research seeks to better understand the conflicts between social and personal information, as well the environmental / genetic factors influencing their adoption. This research is of increasing value in the face of an expanding anthropogenic world. As human activity reshapes pollinator habitats, understanding how insects adapt is critical for ensuring the ecosystem services they provide are not lost.

Open, transparent and reproducible science lie at the core of my working routine and as such I organise my data and maintain my code under [standard practice](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/).

## Other work

### Research Software Engineer, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine

During the 2nd year of my PhD I spend 3 months working on Covid-19 as a research software engineer for the [epiforecasts](https://epiforecasts.io/aboutus/) team at [The Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases (CMMID)](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research/centres/centre-mathematical-modelling-infectious-diseases/covid-19), London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. In this role I was responsible for maintaining and developing existing R packages which provided data used in forecasts provided to both the UK, EU and USA governments. I redeveloped an R package, [covidregionaldata](https://github.com/epiforecasts/covidregionaldata), and oversaw its peer review in the [Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.03290).

### MRes Project, University of Sheffield

During my Mres at Sheffield I worked with [Dr Toni Gossmann](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/aps/staff-and-students/acadstaff/gossmann) and [Dr Chris Cooney](https://www.christophercooney.co.uk/) to investigate the genetic underpinnings of beak shape evolution in birds. During this research I implemented maximum likelihood based models using the ratio of synonymous to non-synonymous substitutions to investigate signatures of selection acting in 18 candidate genes. We then correlated this data with hotspots of rapid beak shape evolution identified from three-dimensional morphometric beak shape scans of 57 birds.

## Computational skills

I work mainly in R, where I have experience writing CRAN listed packages, and Python. I also work in C++ when required, both as stand alone applications or as part of python or R packages. I am comfortable working in bash, SQL, Excel and VBA.

As a [CMEE](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/life-sciences/postgraduate/masters-courses/computational-methods-in-ecology-and-evolution/) graduate, I am well trained in computational methods. As such I adopt a flexible and multilingual approach to programming.

## Other interests
Outside of research I enjoy climbing, hiking and developing my programming skills.
